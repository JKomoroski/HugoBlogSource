Before I provide any guides on my various running projects, I feel the need to describe the lab that I have at my disposal. Today, the lab is very simple consisting of the following hardware components:

* Fiber to the Home 100Mb Connection
* NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 (R7000) Home Router 
* Raspberry Pi 3
* Home Server
    * Ubuntu 17.10 64bit
    * Linux 4.13.0-32-generic
    * Intel Core i7 CPU 860 @ 2.80GHz
    * 16 Gb Ram
    * 4Tb Storage
* Workstation PC
    * Windows 10 Pro N
    * Intel Core i7 CPU 4790K @ 4.00GHz
    * 12 Gb Ram
    * 2Tb Storage

Beyond the items listed above I have my various home hardware and IOT devices on my network (Cellphones, Laptops, IoT, etc).

My Kubernetes cluster (on which nearly all of my services are deployed) is a single node cluster, running only on my home server. In later posts, I'll provide detailed information about my set up and provide links to those posts from this page.

As with any home lab, I have future plans, goals and aspirations for my little lab. This blog is meant to document the improvements to this lab as well as provide some guides for others to follow on their own. I'd like to get off Ubuntu and onto something more server focused. I'd like some additional compute nodes to distribute my services across and some additional networking hardware to properly segment my network. As it stands, it's a start and it works.
