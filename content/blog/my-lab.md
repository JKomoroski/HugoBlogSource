Before I provide any guides on my various running projects, I feel the need to describe the lab that I have at my disposal. Today, the lab is very simple consisting of the following hardware components:

* Fiber to the home 100 Mb connection
* Netgear Nighthawk Home Router ()
* Raspberry Pi 3
* Home Server
* Workstation PC

Beyond the items listed above I have my various home hardware and IOT devices on my network (Cellphones, Laptops, IoT, etc).

My Kubernetes cluster (on which nearly all of my services are deployed) is a single node cluster, running only on my home server. In later posts, I'll provide detailed information about my set up and provide links to those posts from this page.

As with any home lab, I have future plans, goals and aspirations for my little lab. This blog is meant to document the improvements to this lab as well as provide some guides for others to follow on their own.
