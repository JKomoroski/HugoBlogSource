I'm Jared Komoroski, a happy husband, and proud father to a little girl. Professionally, I'm an aspiring Software Test 
Engineer at [Alianza Inc.](https://alianza.com). I live in Eagle Mountain, Utah near the 
[Silicon Slopes](https://siliconslopes.com/) tech hub. I'm a graduate (B.A.) of 
[Southern Utah University](https://www.suu.edu/), where I studied the German Language and English Literature. My degree 
reinforced my identity as an avid reader of histories, biographies, and fiction. I have many passions and hobbies 
including [mechanical keyboards](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards), baking pie, and listening to podcasts.
