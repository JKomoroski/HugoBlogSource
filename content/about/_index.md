I'm Jared Komoroski, a proud husband, and father to a little girl an aspiring Sofware Test Engineer at [Alianza Inc.](https://alianza.com). I live in Eagle Mountain, Utah near the booming [Silicon Slopes](https://siliconslopes.com/) tech hub. I'm a graduate (B.A.) of [Southern Utah University](https://www.suu.edu/), where I studied the German Language and English Literature. My degree reenforced my identity as an avid reader of histories, biographies, and fiction. I have many
passions and hobbies including [mechanical keyboards](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards), League of Legends, and baking pie.
