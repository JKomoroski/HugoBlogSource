I'm Jared Komoroski, a happy husband, and proud father to two little girls. Professionally, I'm an aspiring SDET at 
[Alianza](https://alianza.com). I live in Eagle Mountain, Utah near the [Silicon Slopes](https://siliconslopes.com/)
tech hub. I'm a graduate (B.A.) of [Southern Utah University](https://www.suu.edu/), where I studied the German Language
and English Literature. My degree reinforced my love of histories, biographies, and fiction. In my spare time, I enjoy
working on my 1965 VW Beetle with my girls, and watching too much Star Trek.
